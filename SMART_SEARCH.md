## ✨ Enhanced Search Intelligence

The location search has been upgraded with **generative search capabilities** that understand what you're looking for, even with incomplete or vague terms.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Before:** Basic Search Only
- Had to know exact place names
- "Bondi Beach" ✅
- "blue beach" ❌
- "beach with blue water" ❌

### **After:** Smart Generative Search
- **Exact names** still work: "Bondi Beach" ✅
- **Partial words**: "blue beach" ✅
- **Descriptive terms**: "beach with blue water" ✅
- **Type + keywords**: "italian restaurant" ✅
- **Area-based**: "park near me" ✅

---

## 🚀 Search Capabilities

### 1. **Keyword Splitting**
Breaks your search into individual words and searches each one:
- Search: **"tall tower paris"**
- Finds: Eiffel Tower, other tall structures in Paris

### 2. **Smart Place Type Detection**
Recognizes common place types and combines them with your keywords:
- **Recognized types**: restaurant, cafe, beach, park, museum, hotel, bar, shop, mall
- Search: **"mexican food"** → Automatically searches "mexican restaurant"
- Search: **"coffee downtown"** → Finds "coffee cafe downtown"

### 3. **Multiple Search Strategies**
For each query, the app runs several searches:
1. **Full query** as-is
2. **Individual keywords** (if 3+ characters)
3. **Smart type combinations** (keyword + place type)

### 4. **Intelligent Result Ranking**
Results are sorted by:
1. **Exact matches first** - Places that contain your exact search term
2. **Closest distance** - Nearest places shown first
3. **Duplicate removal** - Same place not shown twice (within 50m radius)
